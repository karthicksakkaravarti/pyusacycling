# Project Name
USA Cycling Results Parser - pyusaccycling

## Project Description
A Python package that scrapes and parses USA Cycling event, results from the legacy USA Cycling results page. The package will extract event details, race results, categories, rankings, and historical data, returning structured data in multiple formats.

## Target Audience
- Developers integrating USA Cycling race data into applications  
- Data analysts needing structured race results  
- Web app developers building cycling-related tools  

## Desired Features
### Core Parsing
- [ ] Fetch event lists (https://legacy.usacycling.org/results/browse.php?state=WA&race=&fyear=2020)
- [ ] Extract event details (name, date, location, permit number)
- [ ] Extract race results from individual events  
- [ ] Parse race categories and rankings  
- [ ] Support fetching historical data for any available year
- [ ] Extract all available data fields from result pages

### Development & Testing
- [ ] Create sample/test HTML pages reflecting USA Cycling result formats
- [ ] Develop parsing logic against test pages before live implementation
- [ ] Include comprehensive test suite with sample data

### Data Validation & Integrity
- [ ] Implement validation for extracted data
- [ ] Verify data formats and types match expected schema
- [ ] Handle edge cases like incomplete or malformed result pages
- [ ] Provide validation reports with warnings for problematic data

### Caching & Performance
- [ ] Implement intelligent caching mechanism to avoid redundant requests
- [ ] Store fetched data with configurable expiration periods
- [ ] Allow force-refresh option to bypass cache when needed
- [ ] Support disk-based caching for persistence between sessions

### Data Output & Storage
- [ ] Return data in user-specified format:  
    - [ ] Pydantic models  
    - [ ] JSON  
    - [ ] CSV  
- [ ] Optionally store parsed results locally for caching  
- [ ] Handle missing or incomplete data gracefully  

### Pagination & Large Data Sets
- [ ] Implement pagination handling for large result sets
- [ ] Support efficient retrieval of large volumes of race data
- [ ] Provide options for batch processing of results

### Automation & Updates
- [ ] Allow scheduled fetching of updated results  
- [ ] Optionally store historical race results for later use  

### Error Handling & Reliability
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Define custom exception types for different failure scenarios:
    - [ ] NetworkError for connection issues
    - [ ] ParseError for HTML parsing failures
    - [ ] ValidationError for data format issues
    - [ ] RateLimitError for throttling detection
- [ ] Handle failed requests, timeouts, and parsing errors  
- [ ] Detect and report missing or malformed data  
- [ ] Retry mechanism for transient failures  

### Rate Limiting & Request Management
- [ ] Implement adaptive throttling strategy with exponential backoff
- [ ] Detect and adapt to USA Cycling website's rate limits
- [ ] Respect website's request limits and avoid bans  
- [ ] Allow configurable request intervals for users  

### Logging & Debugging
- [ ] Implement detailed logging for debugging  
    - [ ] Log request/response details  
    - [ ] Capture and report errors with stack traces  
    - [ ] Allow adjustable log levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR)  

## Technical Implementation
- [ ] Use BeautifulSoup as primary HTML parsing library
- [ ] Design for extensibility to other parsing libraries if needed
- [ ] Focus purely on data extraction without built-in analytics
- [ ] No command-line interface in initial version
- [ ] Target latest Python version (3.9+) with type hints
- [ ] Use modern Python features and best practices

## Design Requests
- [ ] Simple and developer-friendly API  
- [ ] Clear documentation with usage examples  
- [ ] Lightweight dependencies (avoid unnecessary overhead)  
- [ ] Comprehensive docstrings and type annotations

## Other Notes
- Open-source (MIT license)  
- Designed for integration into larger web applications  
- No built-in API or visualization component
